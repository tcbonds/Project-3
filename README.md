# lyme-disease-classifier
Lyme Disease is the the fastest growing contagious disease in the world. For this project, I built a climate-based classification model with a recall of 92% to predict which US counties will have a high incidence of Lyme Disease. This was done by:
* Engineering a dataset from scratch by merging Center for Disease Control data with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate data which was parsed from 78,000 csv files.
* Using KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest algorithms optimized with grid search.
